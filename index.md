# Hi, I'm Justin!

<!-- About Me -->
I'm a New York-born and Los Angeles-raised front-end developer / UI engineer. When I'm not working, you can find me hiking, reading, sipping coffee, or laughing at my own terrible puns.


<!-- My Work -->
I currently work at a mid-size creative agency called **_Zehner_** — where I've helped build sites such as [Stamps.com](https://store.stamps.com/), [FIJI Water](https://www.fijiwater.com), [San Antonio Museum of Art](https://www.samuseum.org/), [Sun Bum](https://www.trustthebum.com/), and [more](https://www.zehnergroup.com/work). Previously I worked on the apartment rental platform, Radpad.

I'm interested in how we can use technology to upgrade our tools and techniques, and help us understand the complexity of the world. From there we’ll be able to develop new thoughts and new solutions to the most pressing issues we face today.

<!-- My Interests -->
<!-- I want to use technology—not to build better mousetraps—but to find better ways of collaborating with each other, and explaining complex ideas. I believe that us humans have this one-in-a-billion chance to make something of this incredible opportunity we've been given as a species. *So let's not waste it.* ***Who's with me?*** -->

<!-- I'm also interested in helping destigmatize mental illness, and create value systems to help people decide how to spend their time. -->
