# Hi, I'm Justin!

<!-- About Me -->
I'm a New York-born and Los Angeles-raised front end developer / UI engineer. When I'm not working, you can find me hiking, reading, sipping coffee, or traveling to my favorite city, Tokyo.


<!-- My Work -->
I currently work at a mid-size creative agency called **_Zehner_** — where I've helped build sites such as [FIJI Water](https://www.fijiwater.com), [San Antonio Museum of Art](https://www.samuseum.org/), [Sun Bum](https://www.trustthebum.com/), [Nuun](https://nuunlife.com/), [Outerknown](https://www.outerknown.com/), and [more](https://www.zehnergroup.com/work). Previously I worked on the apartment rental platform, [Radpad](https://www.onradpad.com/).
