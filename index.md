# Hi, I'm Justin!

<!-- About Me -->
I'm a New York-born and Los Angeles-raised front-end developer / UI engineer. When I'm not working, you can find me hiking, reading, sipping coffee, or laughing at my own terrible puns.


<!-- My Work -->
I currently work at a mid-size creative agency called **_Zehner_** â€” where I've helped build sites such as [Stamps.com](https://store.stamps.com/), [FIJI Water](https://www.fijiwater.com), [San Antonio Museum of Art](https://www.samuseum.org/), [Tailored Pet Nutrition](https://tailoredpet.com/), [Sun Bum](https://www.trustthebum.com/), [Nuun](https://ourcommunity.nuunlife.com/), [Outerknown](https://www.outerknown.com/), and [more](https://www.zehnergroup.com/work). Previously I worked on the apartment rental platform, Radpad.

<!-- My Interests -->
I want to use technology, not to build better mousetraps, but find better ways of communicating, sharing, breaking down, and teaching really complex ideas to people. I believe that we (humans) have this one-in-a-billion chance to make something of this incredible opportunity we've been given as a species. *So let's not waste it.* ***Who's with me?***

  <!-- I'm also interested in helping destigmatize mental illness, and create value systems to help people decide how to spend their time. -->
