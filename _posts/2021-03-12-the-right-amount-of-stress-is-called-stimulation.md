*Energy is coursing through my veins. My hands are clammy. All of my senses are heightened. My thoughts are racing, and I’m starting to panic. I know that I waited until the last minute to study for this exam, but this visceral, overdramatic response seemed far too excessive for what I was facing.*

*I wake up. Another dreary day. I lay there glued to the bed. Gravity seems to be working 10 times as hard on me today. I can practically feel myself sinking into the bed. I feel a massive amount of energy buzzing around me. But instead of compelling me into action, it feels like it's actively trying to hold me down.  I feel trapped. Paralyzed. So uncertain, so overwhelmed that not moving seems like the only option available to me.*

This is how anxiety and depression manifests in me. And for so long I thought something was wrong with me. But what if I told you that these fight, flight or freeze responses were natural reactions? What if I told you this was my brain’s attempt to take care of me? That it was actually practicing compassion towards me, but that  in this modern age it just flat out doesn’t work anymore.

## The Software Got Upgraded, The Hardware Did Not

In our advanced civilized society, we have become so disconnected from what it means to feel human. We mistake negative emotions like stress, and its cousins' procrastination,  anxiety and depression as weakness of character. In reality, these are beacons, signals that something isn't right. If we can reframe how we look at these stressors, we can change our brain and body's response to them.

## Why This Is Important

> There was a study that tracked 30,000 adults in the United States for eight years. And they started by asking people, “how much stress have you experienced in the last year?”  They also asked, “Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health?”, and then they used public death records to find out who died.
> 
> People who **experienced a lot of stress** in the previous year had a **43% increased risk of dying**. But that was **only true for the people** who also **believed that stress is harmful for your health**. People who experienced a lot of stress but **did not view stress as harmful** were no more likely to die. In fact, they **had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study**, including people who had relatively little stress.

People don't have to suffer as much as they think they should. Trauma (and previous conditioning) makes the past overdetermine the present and conjure up a future that identified with doom and chaos. BUT, you change your perspective about these past experiences by changing your interpretive frameworks.

## Evolutionary Background

The human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment. It spent hundreds of thousands of years evolving for an immediate-return environment. With a blink of the eye it all changed.{% sidenote 'evoanx' 'The Evolution of Anxiety, by James Clear' %} This new environment has led to chronic stress and anxiety for humans, because those emotions stopped being useful to help us take action in the face of immediate problems.

We essentially have an ancient alarm system that is often triggered by things that aren't true threats to us. And counterintuitively, the way to fix that hairpin trigger is tuning in (with loving awareness) and letting ourselves fully feel all of the fight, flight, or freeze trauma that our body is carrying with us at that moment. And once you’ve done be sure to thank your brain for trying to protect you and keep you safe.{% sidenote 'fakenews' 'The Fake News of Your Own Mind, Your Undivided Attention (Podcast)' %}
 
## What to Do About It

### Me: Recognize & Respond (With Compassion)
{% marginnote "howtoadhd" "This section was inspired by How to ADHD's video on How to Deal with Rejection Sensitivity" %}

***Step 1 - Recognize**: Where you're at emotionally* 

Whenever you feel distressed — try to check if it is a fight-like, flight-like, or freeze-like response. Focus on the sensation: observing and experiencing, but not judging.

Below are some emotions and their corresponding fear responses: {% sidenote "piotr2" "Don't Fight, Flight (Or Freeze) Your Body and Emotions, by Piotr Migdał ([Image Source](https://kidshelpline.com.au/teens/issues/why-do-i-freak-out))"  %}

- FIGHT: anger / pushing
- FLIGHT: distracting oneself
- FREEZE: numbness, depression, learned helplessness

After you’ve become aware of being triggered, determine how intense the emotions are — because that will inform what strategy to use. To do this, check in with your body:
- Are your fists clenched?
- Are your teeth clenched?
- Is your stomach tight?
- Are you fighting back tears?
- Is your face feeling flushed?

***Step 2 - Respond**: with a strategy that makes sense for your level of emotional intensity*

{% marginfigure 'red-yellow-green' 'assets/img/red-yellow-green.png' 'Emotional Intensity Meter' %}

1. **Green**: emotional intensity is normal, we're thinking clearly
	- This is the time when we feel our most safe and most rational — a good time to work on issues that previously couldn't be handled because emotions were too high
2. **Yellow**: emotions are heightened, but we're somewhat in control
	- This is the time to use strategies to slow us down and calm our brains (like focusing on breathing, going on a short walk, drinking some tea)
3. **Red**: our emotions are so high that we're entering fight, flight, or freeze mode
	- This is the time to use (time-tested) strategies to help us feel safe
	- This is not the time to engage others, or make any brash decisions

***Step 3 - Practice**: Telling your body that you are not in danger* 

When you are “in the green” (emotionally), that’s a great opportunity to practice some exposure therapy. To practice telling your body that it’s not in danger. Exhausted muscles after intensive exercise, burning sensation from chili peppers, the heat of a sauna — these are all great examples of stimuli and stressors that you can use to help retrain your reactions to stress.

These self-awareness skills are not innate — they are like a muscle, and need to be strengthened with exercise. When we practice telling our body that it’s not in danger we are leaning into the discomfort and reducing its power. At the same time, it’s important to be patient with and forgiving of yourself as you go through these motions.

Treat your broken parts like a wounded puppy. Give them time to recover, and don’t push them to walk before they are ready. Don’t you deserve to treat yourself with the same level of compassion as you would this hypothetical dog?

## We: Reduce The Cultural Stigma Around Mental Health

{% marginfigure 'stigma' 'assets/img/stigma.jpg' '[Image Source](https://patientengagementhit.com/news/understanding-stigma-as-a-mental-healthcare-barrier)' %}
Culturally we look at depression and anxiety as irrational and unnecessary suffering. When we treat people this way, we stigmatize them and rob them of hope.{% sidenote "depressionwrong" "We've Got Depression All Wrong. It’s Trying to Save Us." %}

But when we begin to understand that these manifestations of negative energy are adaptive responses to adversity and not mental disorders, we begin to lift the shame around them. And when that shame begins to lift, people who struggle with these emotions can start feeling like courageous survivors, and not damaged invalids.

We often have this optical illusion that we’re the only one’s feeling whatever we're currently feeling, but we can reframe this by asking ourselves, "would anyone else in this situation feel the same thing?" When we reflect, we realize that what we’re going through is what all human beings go through. We are not crazy, or specially defective in any way.
	
## Carrying This Awareness Forward

I believe that by cultivating self-awareness and self-compassion we can channel our negative emotions into life energy and be able to harness them to our advantage. **Because the right amount of *stress* is called <u>stimulation</u>**.
