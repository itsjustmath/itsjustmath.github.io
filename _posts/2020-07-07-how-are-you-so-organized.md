If you've never seen my immaculately clean desk at work, or my meticulously organized apartment, the first thing you'll likely say is, "Whoa. How are you so organized?”  And then, if you somehow by chance made your way into my digital home, you'd likely be asking the same question.

## Clean Space, Clear Mind?

There is something to be said about how organized someone's living and working spaces are, and how that can often be a manifestation of their psyche. In fact, one study found that the more clutter in your field of vision, the more you're going to find yourself getting distracted.

This borderline obsessive level of organizational discipline is not some gimmick though — it's the way I've learned to cope with my ADHD, and a subsequent brain that is maladapted for the domestic, sedentary, delayed-gratification knowledge-worker-life I now live.

But if you've never struggled with tending your metaphorical digital or analog gardens, you're probably wondering how this relates to you. So let's reframe the question from earlier: **How do we free up our brains to focus on what's important? How do we prevent technology companies from exploiting our visceral impulses and derailing us from our pursuit of real value and meaning in life?**

> In the most connected time in history, we're quickly losing touch with ourselves. Overwhelmed by a never-ending flood of information, we're left feeling overstimulated yet restless, overworked yet discontented, tuned in yet burned out."  - Ryder Carroll, The Bullet Journal Method

My belief is that through self-awareness and an understanding of how our (lizard) brains operate, we begin to uncover how technology can work both for and against us. And armed with that knowledge and perspective, we can put systems and processes in place to keep us on track with what's truly important to us.


## Hunter vs. Farmer: A Short Background on ADHD

The prefrontal cortex is one of the more evolved areas of our brains — it governs higher, more-uniquely human, cognitive functions (in particular: predicting outcomes of actions and events, as well as regulating short and long term decision making). If the brain was a series of roads linked together, the prefrontal cortex would be the intersection which the various vehicles of "executive function" (attention, behavior, judgement, and emotional responses) commute through. For the neurotypical brain, all of these cars abide by the rules - stopping at traffic lights and stop signs. There are "no traffic lights, or stops signs for people with ADHD".

During hunter-gatherer times my brain would have been well suited for "an ever-changing environment where the dangers were as unpredictable as our next meal". In this modern era, in order to remain a functional, semi-successful member of society I have had to come up with a series of "mental hacks" to circumvent a brain that is only interested in novelty and short-term gratification.

In reality, having a brain like this has just forced me to confront earlier what others are experiencing now with exploitative, extractive technology.

## How Certain Technology Exploits Our Base Instincts
Attention is now the world's most valuable resource. During most of man's current epoch, big business was concerned with exploitation of natural resources (oil, natural gas, rare earth minerals). But with the advent and maturation of the internet, they discovered that extraction of our attention was exponentially more valuable to them.

Under the guise of “connecting the world” or “organizing the world’s information”, certain misguided megalomaniacs have morphed their platforms and technologies to leverage our deeply embedded survival instincts against us. They prey on our need for approval (to be accepted by our tribe) with their "like" counters. Their intermittent reward notifications have turned our phones into slot machines. Their algorithm-driven feeds calculate that invoking negative emotions (anger, jealousy) keeps users more engaged, so they will keep showing us upsetting content with no regard for psychological or societal consequences.

So, while I can't call up Zuck and try to talk some sense into him, or email Jeff and ask him how many small businesses he's going to trample before he decides to call a quits. I can give you some tips and tricks that have worked for me, and together we can take the power back.

## Lights at the End of the Tunnel

### Struggling with procrastination?
Commit to doing something for ***15 minutes***. If at the end of those 15 minutes, you've had enough - that's fine. The key is getting over that initial hurdle.

### Struggling with self-control or getting staying on track?
Create a sense of urgency and accountability: Use a pomodoro timer. I recommend Be Focused for digital folks, and a Time Timer for those who prefer analog.

Or have software automate the blocking of distracting websites for you: RescueTime offers FocusTime in their premium subscription, Self-Control, and Intention (for Chrome) are both free alternatives.

### Struggling with prioritizing? Too many things on your plate?
Create some constraints: use the Ivy Lee Method. Which says: At the end of each work day, write down the six most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow (no more than six), in order of their true importance. Work until the first task is finished before moving on to the next one. Repeat. (Graphic needed)

### Struggling with time management? Or planning how long things will take?
Add estimates to your six most important tasks. Then add them to  your calendar. Leave the task as an "All Day" event until you've figured out where to slot it in on your calendar for that day. (Graphic Needed)

### Struggling with burnout?
Aware puts a timer in your menu bar showing how long you've been using your computer uninterrupted without a break.

The Pomodoro system calls for a long-break after completing four 25-minute sessions.

### Struggling with keeping track of everything you need to do? Trying to keep too much in your head?
Find an "input-capture and processing" system (BASB/PARA, GTD) that works for you, that you trust and will consistently prune. (My ubiquitous quick capture system involves a mixture of Drafts, Field Notes, and Roam Research.

Reduce cognitive load (ie. the amount of things we need to remember) by offloading minutiae to digital systems. Both Next Meeting, and Fantastical will display your next meeting in your menu bar. (Graphic needed)
### Struggling with digital clutter?
Use Bartender to clean up your menu bar, and Divvy to maximize your screen real estate.

### **Most importantly: take care yourself**
Make sure to slot in recovery time on your calendar.

Remember that stress and anxiety are evolutionary protection mechanisms.

Be compassionate to yourself (and your brain). Be mindful that "the negativity bias is a survival mechanism [that looks] for all the possible dangers (predators) and possible negative outcomes - and protects us from them".

Exercise! Find an outlet for that (negative) energy. When your body is in fight or flight mode, don't try to suppress it.

Practice mindfulness: "What helps is to fully feel [a] feeling. In the body. Understand the stories that it generates in the mind. And to be able to hold all of that with some measure of kindness, or at least willingness to be present with it. And then it can move through us."
